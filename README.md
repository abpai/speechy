# Speechy

This repository is the source code of [Speechy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speechy/flpjdaabfegkkifhogoilelmjcipihnp)., a Chrome Extension for high quality Text-to-Speech(TTS) APIs.

Speechy provides an easy interface for **paid** Text-to-Speech (TTS) APIs. Simply select text and click Speechy from the context menuâ€”that's it. Your browser will read the text aloud using a high-quality voice, which is superior to your OS's default TTS engine or free online APIs.
