# What's this?

Speechy provides an easy interface for **paid** Text-to-Speech (TTS) APIs.
Select text and click Speechy from the context menu. That's it. Your browser reads the text aloud with a high-quality voice compared to your OS's default TTS engine or free online APIs.

We currently support the following APIs:
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API
- OpenAI Text-to-Speech API

# Paid API?

You will find many other chrome extensions that use free TTS APIs or OS’s default TTS engine. Voices generated by these engines are low quality and not comfortable to hear. In contrast, paid APIs generate reasonable voice. Especially, Google’s Cloud Text-to-Speech API and OpenAI Speech API can generate high-quality voice with deep learning technology. The author wanted to use this API in Chrome with easy interface. So this extension was made. If you don’t want to pay for TTS engine, this extension is not for you. However, these APIs won’t cost you so much. For example, Google’s Cloud Text-to-Speech API costs you $16.00 USD / 1 million characters after a 1 million character free tier. So, the author is happy if you give it a try!
