# Speechy: Thank you for installing/updating!

[See what's new in the latest version!](https://github.com/hmirin/speechy/releases)

Major update: Now you can use OpenAI's TTS! It's very natural for English. Please try it out.

‚ùó **Please restart your browser to use Speechy after installation or update. Speechy cannot be used in tabs that were opened before installation or update because of Chrome restrictions.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Notice: The APIs used by Speechy are paid services. You will incur costs based on API usage.**

## Setup

1. You need to get your API key for the API provider you choose. Currently, Speechy supports:
    - [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/)
        - Description: This API provides WaveNet (Deep Learning-based high-quality voice synthesis algorithm) voice. Highly recommended!
        - Follow the instructions on [this link](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158862) to get your API key.
            - For security, we recommend restricting the API key to only the Cloud Text-to-Speech API.
    - [OpenAI Text-to-Speech API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech)
        - Description: This API provides a high-quality voice synthesis algorithm. It's also good.
        - Follow the instructions on [this link](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/) to get your API key.
            - For security, we recommend restricting the API key to only Model capabilities.

2. Click this extension's icon on the address bar, choose an API, add the API key, and click save.

3. Choose the voice you like.

- For Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API:
  - Choose a voice whose language matches the text.
    - For example, en-US-Wavenet-D is for en-US, and the speaker ID is D.
  - We recommend using voices named "Wavenet".
- For OpenAI Text-to-Speech API:
  - All voices are multi-lingual. You don't need to choose a language.
  - However, the quality of the voices for non-English texts is not as advanced. We recommend using the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for non-English text if it is available for your language.

## Usage

1. Select text.
2. Click "Read this with Speechy" from the context menu.
